/**
 * This package contains classes that can be used to show a dialog that tells the user about
 * incorrectly set image bases. In normal use, this dialog is used to tell the user about incorrect
 * image bases whenever the debug client notices a difference between the specified image base of a
 * module in BinNavi and the real image base of a module as picked up by the debug client in the
 * target process.
