/**
 * The SettingsDialog package provides the settings dialog that is used to configure global settings
 * as well as the individual settings components where the user can specify the settings he wants.
 * 
 * The general idea is that the settings dialog provides a tabbed pane where each component is
 * derived from CAbstractSettingsPanel.
